WHERE director like "Steven Spielberg";

Q2: Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order. 

SELECT DISTINCT year FROM Movie
    JOIN Rating ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
WHERE stars = 4 OR stars = 5
ORDER BY year ASC;

Q3: Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 

SELECT Title FROM Movie
WHERE mID NOT IN (SELECT mID FROM Rating);

Q4: Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 

SELECT name FROM Reviewer
    JOIN Rating ON Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL;

Q5: Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 

SELECT name, title, stars, ratingDate FROM Movie
    JOIN Rating ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
    JOIN Reviewer ON Rating.rID = Reviewer.rID
ORDER BY name, title, stars;
